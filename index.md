### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the very first. I got to use a language a computer could understand to print out, "Hello World!, this is Ernie".

* Lab 4, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs since it gave me a bigger insight into programming. The program, "Unit" would ask for an input of millimeters and in response would output four different measurements (tsp, tbsp, oz, and cups).

* Lab 8, part 2 was another one of my top programs since it was the easiest one in my opinion. My partner and I were lazer focused on this one and finished within 30 minutes. The program takes as many numbers as you give and takes the average of all those numbers.
